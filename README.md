# OLEVIBRA_WEARABLE_BRACELET

## Objectives

1. Utilization of a Color-Coded System for Sound Detection: Develop a color-coded 
representation system within the bracelet to visually differentiate between several types of 
sounds present in the user's environment.
2. Incorporation of Vibration Feedback Mechanism: Embed a vibration feature into the 
bracelet design to provide haptic feedback, serving as an alternative sensory alert mechanism, 
particularly beneficial for users with hearing impairments. The intensity of vibrations will 
correspond to the level of surrounding sound, enhancing user awareness and safety.
3. Integration of Sound Direction Detection: Develop a sound direction detection feature to 
enhance spatial awareness and aid users in detecting and identifying nearby sounds. This 
functionality will provide users with valuable information about the origin and direction of 
sounds in their environment, further enhancing accessibility and safety.
Through the implementation of these functionalities, the project aims to significantly enhance user 
awareness, safety, and overall accessibility in diverse environments, with a particular focus on 
improving the experience for users with hearing disabilities

## Description

DIY Wristband Creation: Develop a wristband through (DIY): The band was sewed 
specifically for this project and made adjustable for different patient to be able to wear it , 
featuring a built-in microphone array engineered to detect surrounding sounds with a 
specialized resolution covering 360 degrees.
2. Audio Processing System: Design and implement a robust audio processing system 
where captured audio from the microphone array is forwarded to a preprocessor for 
refinement and optimization.
3. Deep Learning Prediction Models: Train two deep learning models to analyze the 
preprocessed audio data and make accurate predictions regarding the detected sounds.
4. Visual Coding Output: Develop a visual coding system that generates intuitive visual 
cues based on the predictions made by the deep learning models. These visual cues are 
specifically tailored to assist hard-of-hearing individuals in understanding and 
interpreting the surrounding auditory environment.
5. Vibration Feedback Mechanism: Implement a vibration feedback mechanism within the 
wristband to complement the visual coding system. Vibrations are triggered based on the 
predictions made by the deep learning models, providing additional sensory alerts for hard of hearing users.
